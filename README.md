TIGER KING SIMULATOR 

Our project, a Ruby CLI, will simulate the characters, actions, and tigers found on the beloved Netflix Series "Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness" which took the world by storm. 

In our TIGER KING SIMULATOR, you will have the option of playing as one of four of the main zookeeepers on the show: 

1) Joe Exotic, owner of the Greater Wynnewood Exotic Animal Park 
2) Carole Baskin, founder of Big Cat Rescue 
3) Doc Bhagavan Antle, passionate animal conservationist in Myrtle Beach
4) Jeff Lowe, Joe Exotic's Rival Zookeeper 

You will have the unique opportunity to found your own Zoo, where you will start with a designated funding amount. Be careful who you choose, because some zookeepers have more money to work with than others!

In TIGER KING SIMULATOR, your goal is to generate as much money for your zoo and beat out other zookeepers on the highscores table. As the zookeeper of your own zoo, you will be tasked with managing your tigers in a variety of ways. 

You can purchase tigers, sell your tigers to generate more income and showcase your tigers at the local mall (which will generate income but decrease your tiger's health points by a randomly generated number). 

You also have the option of checking on the status of your tigers, buy food for your tigers and feed them with whatever food is stocked in your food inventory. Be mindful that certain tigers would prefer a certain food product over another! Keep your tigers well-fed, because they may end up dying if you don't feed them after some time. 

Best of luck in your zookeeping endeavors!
